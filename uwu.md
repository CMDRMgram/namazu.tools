# The Weapons Refrain

The Weapons Refrain is a multi-phase fight that covers an alternative retelling of the Warrior of Light's fight against the Primals and the Ultima Weapon.

{: .note }
This fight is commonly referred to as **UWU** for *Ultima Weapon: Ultimate*, and frankly I agree its a better abbreviation than **TWR** too...

The fight will see you squaring off against Garuda, Ifrit and Titan before completing a LB3-filled intermission with Lahabrea before facing the Ultima Weapon itself, angrier than ever.

Throughout the first 3 phases, you will be aiming to complete special requirements to **Awaken** all three primals, once awoken their mechanics may change and they will drop a puddle (Candy) when they die, this must be picked up in a specific order, these will give you extra LB3's later which are required to clear the fight.

**Healer > Caster > Melee**

## Phase 1: Garuda
[Toolbox](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=882261013862561&preview=1){: .btn .btn-blue }

### Important Mechanics

{: .warning }
**Feather Rain** - Garuda will make a shriek sound and without any castbar, feathers will drop on all players, this will happen many times during the fight.

{: .tanks }
> **Slipstream** is a dodge-able cleave, be careful not to face this into the party.
> 
> **Downburst**, a heavy physical Tankbuster which will require mitigation.

This summary is written to accompany the above toolbox, use it as a reference.

The phase starts with the MT pulling boss to mid and facing boss north. DPS should be behind boss and OT and Healers stay east with the OT between Healers and the boss. One Healer will get Mistral Song, the boss will send a ranged attacked to Healers and OT will soak the hit with Healers (first hit takes more damage)

### Plumes
Multiple Plumes will spawn around the arena. OT needs to grab the Spiny plume and be ready for heavy damage.

{: .warning }
STOP AOE IMMEDIATELY. The Spiny plume will become fixated on the first person to deal damage to it, this MUST be the OT.

Once the plumes have gathered on the party, AOE them down leaving the Spiny plume with some health left (aim for 25%ish).

After Feather Rain, kill the spiny plume to spawn a bubble, party can then move into this ready for cleanses.

### Cleanses
The following is a mechanic where we will take turns to gain and cleanse stacks by entering and leaving bubble, the order is very precise and required to be able to clear the fight, if you fail the order but survive the mechanic, you will fail later mechanics.

- Kill spiny plume, everyone except OT move into bubble.
- After Raidwide, OT enter bubble and cleanse stacks.
- OT and Melee leave bubble and wait outside.
- Friction 1: Heavy party damage, Stacks applied to OT and Melee, Party leaves bubble.
- Friction 2: Heavy party damage, Stacks applied to everyone, Party leaves bubble.
- Wait for party to be healed, First Melee cleanses stacks (Enter and exit bubble)
- Wait for party to be healed, Second Melee cleanses stacks (Enter and exit bubble)

{: .healers }
This is one of the biggest damage checks in this phase, use your big mits/CDs and don't be afraid to spam heal.

{: .warning }
Stay relatively stacked during this mechanic, friction is a small range and can miss people if you are too spread out.

{: .note }
If you did this mechanic correctly, the boss will now have 3 stacks of awakened. The last stack to Awaken the boss will apply later.

### Twins
Party to stack on **Waymark 4**, Mistral Songs will target two non-tanks from sisters. MT and OT dodge Wicked Wheel (PBAOE) and stand on a cardinal in-front of each sister against edge of blue circle, intercepting one of the Mistral Songs each.

{: .tanks }
> Intercept Priority
> 
> - MT = NORTH > EAST
> - OT = SOUTH > WEST

After feather rain, Party and Tanks to dodge Tornadoes (Spawning on tank locations) and then group up in mid.

{: .note }
If Tornadoes are on SOUTH and EAST, ranged can dodge out towards wall for safety.

### Tethers
Second plumes spawn, wait for them to gather and AOE them down as fast as possible. OT takes EAST Tether, Caster take WEST Tether, walk Tether to edge of blue circle. Heavy Raidwide and **Downburst** on MT, followed by feather rain.

Party stack behind Garuda and burn down the boss, you should phase at this point.

If you don't phase, you will need to look out for Wicked Wheel, a quick donut/aoe dodge.

**Enrage Timer is 2:55**

When you kill Garuda, DPS and Tanks stack middle, Healer grab the Glowing Puddle (Candy) for later.

## Phase 2: Ifrit
[Toolbox](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=562530446784261&preview=1){: .btn .btn-blue }

### Important Mechanics

{: .tanks }
**Incinerate** - Untelegraphed Tankbuster, Triple tankbuster with no broadcast, typically use invlun, darkness damage.

{: .healers }
**Searing Wind** - One of the two healers will be targetted with a debuff, this will last for some time and cause periodic explosions around you, anyone caught in this will die. When you have this, watch the debuff and ensure you are out of the party stack.
**Vulcan Burst** - Large Low-Damage AOE with knockback, needs to be mitigated by applying shields.

{: .dps }
**Eruptions** - Ifrit will target the furthest players and cast a series of large explosions, these will be baited by ranged players and need to be baited away from the party. During Nails, you will use these to buff the nails for awakening.

Start the phase by stacking mid, orient to Ifrit and dodge left/right based on safe-spot. Shield healer prepare for Vulcan Burst with shields and Tanks prepare for Incinerate with a vuln.

### Nails

Four nails will spawn, orient yourself so the closest two nails are north. One Healer will get Searing wind, take this to relative south and stay on the wall, top yourself up as necessary and focus boss.

Ranged will split and bait eruptions at SE and SW, moving up to hit each nail twice with an eruption, this will cause the nails to grow. Once the nails have been hit twice, destroy them in the following order.
