# The Weapons Refrain

The Weapons Refrain is a multi-phase fight that covers an alternative retelling of the Warrior of Light's fight against the Primals and the Ultima Weapon.

{: .note }
This fight is commonly referred to as **UWU** for *Ultima Weapon: Ultimate*, and frankly I agree its a better abbreviation than **TWR** too...

The fight will see you squaring off against Garuda, Ifrit and Titan before completing a LB3-filled intermission with Lahabrea before facing the Ultima Weapon itself, angrier than ever.

## Special Notes

### Candy
Throughout the first 3 phases, you will be aiming to complete special requirements to **Awaken** all three primals, once awoken their mechanics may change and they will drop a puddle (Candy) when they die, this must be picked up in a specific order, these will give you extra LB3's later which are required to clear the fight.

**Healer > Caster > Melee**

## Phase 1: Garuda

The phase starts with the MT pulling boss to mid and facing boss north. DPS should be behind boss and OT and Healers stay east with the OT between Healers and the boss. 

MT to dodge the Cleave attack (**Slipstream**)

One Healer will get Mistral Song, the boss will send a ranged attacked to Healers and OT will soak the hit with Healers (first hit takes more damage)

Party should ALL move WEST to avoid the tornado spawning under Healers.

### Plumes

1. Plumes will spawn around the arena. 
    {: .warning } 
    STOP AOE IMMEDIATELY. The Spiny plume will become fixated on the first person to deal damage to it, this MUST be the OT.
1. Once the plumes have gathered on the party, AOE them down leaving the Spiny plume with some health left (aim for 25%ish)
1. MT dodge **Slipstream**, then move back in and take Downburst (Heavy Phys Tankbuster)
1. **Feather Rain**: Listen for Garuda Shriek, when you hear the noise, move.
    {: .note }
    Feather Rain occurs many times in this fight, get familiar with the sound of Garuda Shrieking and react accordingly.
    ### Cleanses
    The following is a mechanic where we will take turns to gain and cleanse stacks by entering and leaving bubble, the order is very precise and required to be able to clear the fight, if you fail the order but survive the mechanic, you will fail later mechanics.
1. Kill spiny plume, everyone except OT move into bubble.
1. After Raidwide, OT enter bubble and cleanse stacks.
1. OT and Melee leave bubble and wait outside.
1. Friction 1: Heavy party damage, Stacks applied to OT and Melee, Party leaves bubble.
1. Friction 2: Heavy party damage, Stacks applied to everyone, Party leaves bubble.
1. Wait for party to be healed, First Melee cleanses stacks (Enter and exit bubble)
1. Wait for party to be healed, Second Melee cleanses stacks (Enter and exit bubble)
    {: .healers } 
    This is one of the biggest damage checks in this phase, use your big mits/CDs and don't be afraid to spam heal.
    {: .warning }
    Stay relatively stacked during this mechanic, friction is a small range and can miss people if you are too spread out.
    {: .note }
    If you did this mechanic correctly, the boss will now have 3 stacks of awakened. The last stack to Awaken the boss will apply later.
1. **Feather Rain**: Listen for Garuda Shriek, when you hear the noise, move.

**Aerial Blast**: Heavy Raidwide. Party stack tightly slightly south of mid.

Sisters will spawn.

**Feather Rain**: Listen for Garuda Shriek, when you hear the noise, move.

Party to stack on **Waymark 4**, Mistral Songs will target two non-tanks from sisters.

MT and OT dodge Wicked Wheel (PBAOE) and stand on a cardinal in-front of each sister against edge of blue circle, intercepting one of the Mistral Songs each.

{: .tanks }
> Intercept Priority
> 
> MT = NORTH > EAST
>
> OT = SOUTH > WEST

**Feather Rain**: Listen for Garuda Shriek, when you hear the noise, move.

Party and Tanks to dodge Tornadoes (Spawning on tank locations)

{: .note }
If Tornadoes are on SOUTH and EAST, ranged can dodge out towards wall for safety.

Party to stack behind boss.

Second plumes spawn, wait for them to gather and AOE them down as fast as possible.

OT takes EAST Tether, Caster take WEST Tether, walk Tether to edge of blue circle.

Heavy Raidwide and **Downburst** on MT, followed by **Feather Rain**: Listen for Garuda Shriek, when you hear the noise, move.

Party stack behind Garuda, burn down boss, should phase at this point.

Otherwise: 
1. Slipstream
2. Wicked Wheel (Dodge out of AOE and then in IMMEDIATELY)
3. Downburst
4. Slipstream
5. Enrage

**Enrage Timer is 2:55**

When you kill Garuda, DPS and Tanks stack middle, Healer grab the Glowing Puddle (Candy) for later.
