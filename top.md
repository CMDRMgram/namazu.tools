### Waymarks
Waymarks are incredibly important in TOP as they are used for many mechanics in the fight for easy solves.

## Phase 1

{: .tanks }
> It is very important in this phase to keep Omega in the center of the arena.

The phase begins with heavy hitting auto-attacks before starting the first mechanic:

### Program Loop

Program loop begins with each player being assigned a number from 1 to 4, with two of each across the party. This mechanic requires 4 sets of 2 towers to be soaked in a sequential order **(1->2->3->4)** that will deal significant damage to the player inside. 

For each set of towers that needs to be soaked, two tethers must be taken by two players and taken away from the towers in the order **(3->4->1->2)**.

These tethers will explode in a large AOE on the targeted player and inflict a HP penalty debuff which will wear off after 10 seconds. 

{: .healers }
> The 3 and 4 players will have their HP penalty falling off as they need to soak their towers, so a priority system between the healers is used to heal both players.

{: .tanks }
> Personal mitigations can be used to help heal up the 3 and 4 players.

As this mechanic can become messy with players grabbing tethers from others and taking different towers, a priority system is used to facilitate the movement of players. The priority used by MUR PF is seen in the cheatsheet.

### Pantokrator

Pantokrator begins and assigns each player with a number from 1 to 4 again, indicating the order that Omega will drop a small AOE on players. Omega will then cast **flamethrower** and cleave two pizza slices of the arena on a random opposite cardinals/intercardinals. 

Players will need to **split into groups of 4**, with each group containing only one of each number from 1 - 4. This is done by the priority system used in program loop, with higher priority players moving to the SW party and lower priority players moving to the NE party. 

If Omega cleaves the NE and SW waymarkers first, then each party rotates to the safespot clockwise of their original position. **(image here)**

The cleaves will then either rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise. As the cleaves rotate, each player will also leave behind puddles. The party stacks together at the rear cleave to take a **3 player line-stack**, whilst the numbers leave to take their AOE away from the group before joining back to the party. This process repeats until each number has taken their AOE and the cleaves cease.

{: .Everyone }
> It is very easy for the puddles to get out of hand, so stack as tightly as possible and move along the edge of **Omega's hitbox** whilst moving as a group. 

> Players whose turn it is to leave the stack should wait for a puddle to drop under their feet before exiting the stack. Using **sprint** can help but isn't required.

Omega will then cast two tank buster cleaves on the two furthest players, and 6 line AOEs on the non-tanks. Both tanks **stack north, outside of the hitbox** using invulnerability and the party spreads within Omegas hitbox as seen in the cheatsheet.

After this Omega will cast Atomic Ray, it's enrage.
