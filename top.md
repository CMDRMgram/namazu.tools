### Waymarks
Waymarks are incredibly important in TOP as they are used for many mechanics in the fight for easy solves.


Guide written by Juno

## Phase 1: Omega

{: .tanks }
> It is very important in this phase to keep Omega in the center of the arena.

The phase begins with heavy hitting auto-attacks before starting the first mechanic:

### Program Loop

Program loop begins with each player being assigned a number from 1 to 4, with two of each across the party. This mechanic requires 4 sets of 2 towers to be soaked in a sequential order **(1->2->3->4)** that will deal significant damage to the player inside. 

For each set of towers that needs to be soaked, two tethers must be taken by two players and taken away from the towers in the order **(3->4->1->2)**.

These tethers will explode in a large AOE on the targeted player and inflict a HP penalty debuff which will wear off after 10 seconds. 

{: .healers }
> The 3 and 4 players will have their HP penalty falling off as they need to soak their towers, so a priority system between the healers is used to heal both players.

{: .tanks }
> Personal mitigations can be used to help heal up the 3 and 4 players.

As this mechanic can become messy with players grabbing tethers from others and taking different towers, a priority system is used to facilitate the movement of players. The priority used by MUR PF is seen in the cheatsheet.

### Pantokrator

{: .healers }
> Pantokrator has a lot of damage going out from the stacks and spreads, and requires heavy mitigation before spreading into your light parties.

Pantokrator begins and assigns each player with a number from 1 to 4 again, indicating the order that Omega will drop a small AOE on players. Omega will then cast **flamethrower** and cleave two pizza slices of the arena on a random opposite cardinals/intercardinals. 

Players will need to **split into groups of 4**, with each group containing only one of each number from 1 - 4. This is done by the priority system used in program loop, with higher priority players moving to the SW party and lower priority players moving to the NE party. 

If Omega cleaves the NE and SW waymarkers first then each party rotates to the safespot clockwise of their original position. **(image here)**

The cleaves will then either rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise. As the cleaves rotate each player will also leave behind puddles. The party stacks together at the rear cleave to take a **3 player line-stack**, whilst the numbers leave to take their AOE away from the group before joining back to the party. This process repeats until each number has taken their AOE and the cleaves cease.

{: .warning }
> It is very easy for the puddles to get out of hand, so stack as tightly as possible and move along the edge of Omega's hitbox whilst moving as a group. 
>
> Players whose turn it is to leave the stack should wait for a puddle to drop under their feet before exiting the stack. Using **sprint** can help but isn't required.

Omega will then cast two tank buster cleaves on the two furthest players, and 6 line AOEs on the non-tanks. Both tanks **stack north, outside of the hitbox** and use invulnerability, and the party spreads within Omegas hitbox as seen in the cheatsheet.

After this Omega will cast it's enrage: **Atomic Ray**.

## Phase 2: Omega-M & F

{: .tanks }
> Rampart can be cast as Omega "jumps", allowing a usage during the opening tank buster and in Limitless Synergy

Phase 2 begins and Omega-M and Omega-F will spawn. 

{: .damage }
> There is about a 2 GCD window once both bosses become targetable where they are susceptible to cleave damage and this should be abused as much as possible. 
> 
> 2 minute raid buffs should be used either before they are targetable or on the 1st GCD.

Omega-M and F will then cast **Firewall**, targeting the 4 closest players to each boss. If a player is close to M they will be inflicted with **Packet Filter F** and be unable to damage Omega-F. If a player is close to F the opposite happens. 

The party will split up into light parties for this so each boss will have a healer, tank, and two DPS able to damage it.

Both bosses will then tank buster the player with highest emnity to them, followed by 3 auto-attacks.

Omega-M and Omega-F will then cast:

### Party Synergy

Both bosses will become untargetable and disappear as the mechanic begins. 

The party is inflicted with either **Mid Glitch** or **Remote Glitch**. Each player is also assigned 1 of 4 coloured symbols above their head, with two of each. 

{: .everyone }
> The party should line-up from East to West as seen in the cheatsheet. 
> 
> The furthest West symbol of a pair will be designated as Light Party 1, whilst the furthest East will be designated Light Party 2.

At the same time, **Omega's Eye** will spawn on a random cardinal/intercardinal. **This will be designated as relative north**.

Clones will then spawn around the center of the arena, 2 Omega-M, and 2 Omega-F. An Omega-M and Omega-F pair will always be facing eachother and should be focused on. These two clones will perform a set of AOEs that are dependant on the weapons they are holding.

The possible combinations are:

| Female | Male   |
|:-------|:------ |
| Staff  | Shield |
| Staff  | Sword  |
| Skates | Shield |
| Skates | Sword  |

[![][(https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/862721895962902589/1108334543196409917/p2_dodges.png)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/862721895962902589/1108334543196409917/p2_dodges.png)

{: .note }
> The "cursed" pattern (F-Staff & M-Shield) can be easily resolved by using the far edges of the waymarks eitherside of the male.
> 
> These waymarks also help to position during Mid/Remote Glitch.

Once the dodge is made, all players must resolve their Mid/Remote Glitch by splitting into the previously designated light parties and moving to the West (LP1) and East (LP2) **relative to Omega's Eye**. 

After each player takes an AOE, two stacks will then appear on two random players. Multiple clones will spawn around the arena, including a line of 3 Males, and 1 Female in the center. Using the **middle of the 3 males as relative north**, the party must form two stacks in their designated light parties around the female to get pushed back to 1 of 3 safe spots.

Light Party 1 will always anchor West, and Light Party 2 will either be pushed South for Mid Glitch, or East for Remote Glitch.

If the stack players are part of the **same light party** the south most stack relative to the eye must swap positions with their partner. **(video)**

{: .tanks }
> Between the start of the phase and after party synergy Omega-M has changed to Omega-F and vice versa, meaning you will both have to re-provoke your boss.

{: .everyone }
> The party should pre-position at South-West for the upcoming mechanic.

After ~5 auto-attacks from each boss, both Omega-M and Omega-F will cast:

### Limitless Synergy

{: .damage }
> As the Limitless Synergy cast finishes the Packet Filter debuff will disappear, allowing about 1/2 GCDs of cleave damage.

Omega-F will become invulnerable, forcing the party to attack the Male. Two tethers will spawn on two random players, orginating from two Omega clones. Both tanks will grab their designated tether (as seen in the cheatsheet).

At the same time, a Male clone will spawn on a random cardinal/intercardinal and cast **Optimized Sagitarrius Arrow** on a random player. This AOE will bait across the hitbox but leave a safe spot within it, which the non-tanks will move into.

{: .tanks }
> Once the AOE is baited, both tanks take their tether to the wall close to their clone and rotate clock wise on the edge of the arena. Heavy personal mitigation is required to survive this tank buster.
>
> While you are taking your tank buster you should also find where the **shield male** is.

Once the tank busters resolve, everyone but the tanks should **stack under Omega-M** as 3 flare markers will appear on 3 random players. These can be ignored. The Male clone with a shield that is on the edge of the arena will then cast **Beyond Defense** which will be baited by both tanks.

The tank that was not hit joins the stack, and the tank that was hit should then move away from the Male so that the stack is closest to the Male's new position as it will then cast **Pile Pitch**.

{: .everyone }
>This strategy requires **HEAVY** mitigation to survive, as not only are you stacking all the flares, you are also taking a stack and then a heavy hitting raidwide immediately after. 
>
>To cover both sets of hits, you can cast your mitigation at around 4/5 pulses of the flares.

Throughout this whole mechanic Omega F has been casting her enrage **Laser Shower**. Once Omega-M is defeated, Omega-F becomes targetable. 

Upon defeating Omega-F, the transition begins:

### Phase 2 -> Phase 3 Transition

{: .everyone }
>The party should line-up from East to West as seen in the cheatsheet before debuffs are assigned. 

{: .healers }
> To survive this transition the party must have *at least* a barrier healer's shield covering the hits.

The debuffs assigned will target 4 players with **Sniper Cannon Fodder** (spread), 2 players with **High-powered Sniper Cannon Fodder** (stack) and 2 players will not be assigned a debuff.

Players must spread according to their debuff and priority, with the stacks and non-debuff players along the south edge of the arena, and the spread players along the north edge.

Two sets of **Arms** will appear that will cause large circular AOEs, as well as a cascading donut AOE (Wave Repeater) originating from the center. To resolve this, players will dodge Wave Repeater by moving in and out from the edge of the arena, and then dodging into the first arm explosion where they will take their spread or stack. **video**

{: .note }
> Using **sprint** can help make the 2->1 dodge easier, but isn't required.

## Phase 3: Reconfigured Omega

{: .tanks }
> There are hard hitting auto-attacks throughout this entire phase. The OT should be using their targeted mitigation on the MT as much as possible to help reduce the strain on the healers.

{: .healers }
> This phase requires high mitigation for each **Latent Defect**. Use the mitigation sheet provided, and allow the shield healer to get close to the center of the arena to mitigate damage before each **Latent Defect**.

The phase begins with a hard-hitting raid wide cast:

### Hello World

This mechanic assigns **a lot** of debuffs to players. Thankfully, most of them can be ignored as they will resolve themselves simply by doing the mechanic and are only present as fail conditions for doing it *incorrectly*.

For those interested I've attached the ignorable debuffs in the dropdown below:

<details markdown=1>
<summary>Hello World Debuffs</summary>

**Cascading Latent Defect**
> Received from soaking a red puddle. Cleansed by allowing **Critical Underflow Bug** to expire. Failing to do so will wipe the raid.

**Latent Performance Defect**
> Received from soaking a blue puddle. Cleansed by allowing **Critical Performance Bug** to expire. Failing to do so will wipe the raid.

**Latent Defect**
> Players must take damage before the debuff expires or they will die. This is assigned to **Christmas Tether** players.

**Latent Synchronization Bug**
> Must be hit by **Critical Synchronization Bug** to remove. Failure to do so results in death.

</details>

To actually resolve the mechanic we only care about 5 of them however:

- **Critical Underflow Bug** (aka Red Rot)
- **Critical Performance Bug** (aka Blue Rot)
- **Critical Overflow Bug** (aka Defamation)
- **Critical Synchronization Bug** (aka Stack)
- **Local Code Smell/Local Regression** (aka Christmas Tether)
- **Remote Code Smell/Remote Regression** (aka Blue Tether)

Throughout the phase, each player will have to get each of these debuffs. Once you have received and resolved your debuff, you will become immune to getting it again.

Omega will then begin casting **Latent Defect**, causing 2 red and 2 blue puddles to spawn. The corresponding rot players will have to soak these puddles. As rot passes on contact, these players should be extremely cautious getting to their positions

**Critical Overflow Bug** and **Critical Synchronization Bug** are assigned randomly to one colour of rot. This will persist through the rest of the mechanic such that if red is defamation to begin with, red will be defamation for the remainder of the mechanic.

**Stack rots** should be as close to eachother as they can while still resolving their blue puddle, and **defamation rots** should be on the far edges of their puddles.

{: .note }
> MUR has the stack rot players move inside the boss' hitbox, whilst the defamation players move outside the hitbox.
>
> Tether players should also give way to rots to reduce car crashes.

Tethers players will initially have an "inactive" buff, meaning that they can be any distance away from eachother without causing it to break. Once their tether becomes active, if **Blue Tethers** move far apart, the tether will break, and if **Christmas Tethers** move close together, their tether will break. Both breaks cause **high raid-wide** "patch" damage and a **Thrice-come Ruin debuff** to be inflicted on each player.

Failing to break a tether before it expires results in a wipe.

The **Blue Tether** players will move to the stack rots and in between the puddles, each player stacking close to a rot player. After the stack hits, the **Blue Tether** players can move out to give themself rot by stacking **on top** of the rot player, forcing the tether to break in the process.

{: .warning }
> Popping the **Blue Tether** *too* early can cause wipes as the initial hits from defamation and the stack give a magic vulnerability debuff for 1 second.

The **Christmas Tether** players will be standing outside the puddle next to the defamation players, and giving themself rot once the defamation AOE occurs. They will then break their tether by **getting close to one another**, being careful not to do it too soon after the first tether break as it will wipe the raid due to **Thrice-come Ruin**.

This mechanic repeats **Latent Defect** a total of 4 times, where for the final **Latent Defect** all players (except defamation) will move to the **stack rot** side. This will cause the **Christmas Tether** to break immediately, and then the **Blue Tether** will be broken manually after.

After rots expire Omega will cast another hard hitting raid wide **Critical Error**, before starting the next mechanic:

## Monitors

{: .everyone }
> Players should pre-position in the cheatsheet lineup for monitors to quickly find their spots.

After ~3 more auto-attacks, Omega will begin to cast **Oversampled Wave Cannon** and point a set of blue monitors either true east or true west. 

3 random players will also be inflicted with **Oversampled Wave Cannon Loading**, putting the same east/west facing monitors on their person. Players must position and align themselves such that **each monitor** is only hitting **2 people** at a time. If hit by a monitor, a large AOE will explode on the player for high damage and they will be inflicted by **Twice-come Ruin**.

Misaligning your monitor will result in players either: not being hit by monitor, or hit by 2+ monitors which will result in **doom** being inflicted, resulting in death.

{: .note }
> The monitor positions "lock-in" at the very end of the **Oversampled Wave Cannon** cast, allowing monitor players to greed GCDs. 

If solved correctly, Omega will cast it's enrage: **Ion Efflux**.

## Phase 4: Blue Screen
{: .damage }
> Depending on team comp or damage needs, mDPS LB3 can be sent at the end of P3 or at the start of P4. Sending in P4 requires 2 mins to be used during **monitors**.

This phase is fairly straight forward, with each player taking a protean and then stacking south of the boss. Just before the 2nd proteans, the party must step in to avoid **Wave Repeater**. Similiarly, after the 3rd stack the party must wait, and then step in to avoid another **Wave Repeater**.

If two stacks appear on one side of the boss, the southmost stack adjusts to the other side, and the opposite sides mDPS flexes.

Omega must be below 20% health before it's enrage is cast: **Blue Screen**.

## Phase 5: Dynamis M & F - (Run:Dynamis)
This phase is very mechanically heavy, having 3 trios and lasting approximately 5 minutes.

{: .everyone }
> Each Run:Dynamis cast comes with a **HEAVY** raid-wide hit that should be appropriately mitigated by every class.



## Phase 6: Alpha Omega
