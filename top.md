# The Omega Protocol

## Phase 1: 

The phase begins with heavy hitting auto-attacks before starting the first mechanic:

### Program Loop

The mechanic begins with each player being assigned 1 of 4 numbers, with two of each. Program loop requires 4 sets of 2 towers to be soaked in a sequential order **(1->2->3->4)** that will deal significant damage to the player inside. 

For each set of towers that needs to be soaked, two tethers must be taken by two players and taken away from the towers in the order **(3->4->1->2)**.

The tethers will explode in a large AOE on the targeted player and inflict a (HP down debuff) which will wear off after (---seconds) 

{: .healers }
> The 3 and 4 players will have their HP debuff falling off as they need to soak their towers, so a priority system between the healers is used to heal both players.

{: .tanks }
> Personal mitigations can be used to help heal up the 3 and 4 players.

As this mechanic can become messy with players grabbing tethers from others and taking different towers, a priority system is used to facilitate the movement of players.

### Pantokrator

{: .tanks }
It is very important in this mechanic to pre-position Omega in the center of the arena, as it does not center itself.
