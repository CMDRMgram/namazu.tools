### Waymarks
Waymarks are incredibly important in TOP as they are used for many mechanics in the fight for easy solves.

## Phase 1

{: .tanks }
> It is very important in this phase to keep Omega in the center of the arena.

The phase begins with heavy hitting auto-attacks before starting the first mechanic:

### Program Loop

Program loop begins with each player being assigned a number from 1 to 4, with two of each across the party. This mechanic requires 4 sets of 2 towers to be soaked in a sequential order **(1->2->3->4)** that will deal significant damage to the player inside. 

For each set of towers that needs to be soaked, two tethers must be taken by two players and taken away from the towers in the order **(3->4->1->2)**.

These tethers will explode in a large AOE on the targeted player and inflict a HP penalty debuff which will wear off after 10 seconds. 

{: .healers }
> The 3 and 4 players will have their HP penalty falling off as they need to soak their towers, so a priority system between the healers is used to heal both players.

{: .tanks }
> Personal mitigations can be used to help heal up the 3 and 4 players.

As this mechanic can become messy with players grabbing tethers from others and taking different towers, a priority system is used to facilitate the movement of players. The priority used by MUR PF is seen in the cheatsheet.

### Pantokrator

Pantokrator begins and assigns each player with a number from 1 to 4 again, indicating the order that Omega will drop a small AOE on players. Omega will then cast **flamethrower** and cleave two pizza slices of the arena on a random opposite cardinals/intercardinals. 

Players will need to **split into groups of 4**, with each group containing only one of each number from 1 - 4. This is done by the priority system used in program loop, with higher priority players moving to the SW party and lower priority players moving to the NE party. 

If Omega cleaves the NE and SW waymarkers first then each party rotates to the safespot clockwise of their original position. **(image here)**

The cleaves will then either rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise. As the cleaves rotate each player will also leave behind puddles. The party stacks together at the rear cleave to take a **3 player line-stack**, whilst the numbers leave to take their AOE away from the group before joining back to the party. This process repeats until each number has taken their AOE and the cleaves cease.

{: .warning }
> It is very easy for the puddles to get out of hand, so stack as tightly as possible and move along the edge of Omega's hitbox whilst moving as a group. 
>
> Players whose turn it is to leave the stack should wait for a puddle to drop under their feet before exiting the stack. Using **sprint** can help but isn't required.

Omega will then cast two tank buster cleaves on the two furthest players, and 6 line AOEs on the non-tanks. Both tanks **stack north, outside of the hitbox** and use invulnerability, and the party spreads within Omegas hitbox as seen in the cheatsheet.

After this Omega will cast **Atomic Ray**, it's enrage.

## Phase 2

Phase 2 begins and Omega-M and Omega-F will spawn. 

{: .damage }
> There is about a 2 GCD window once both bosses become targetable where they are susceptible to cleave damage and this should be abused as much as possible. 
> 
> 2 minute raid buffs should be used either before they are targetable or on the 1st GCD.

Omega-M and F will then cast **Firewall**, targeting the 4 closest players to each boss. If a player is close to M they will be inflicted with **Packet Filter F** and be unable to damage Omega-F. If a player is close to F the opposite happens. 

The party will split up into light parties for this so each boss will have a healer, tank, and two DPS able to damage it.

Both bosses will then tank buster the player with highest emnity to them, followed by 3 auto-attacks.

Omega-M and Omega-F will then cast:

### Party Synergy

Both bosses will become untargetable and disappear as the mechanic begins. 

The party is inflicted with either **Mid Glitch** or **Remote Glitch**. Each player is also assigned 1 of 4 coloured symbols above their head, with two of each. 

{: .everyone }
> The party should line-up from East to West as seen in the cheatsheet. 
> 
> The furthest West symbol of a pair will be designated as Light Party 1, whilst the furthest East will be designated Light Party 2.

At the same time, **Omega's Eye** will spawn on a random cardinal/intercardinal. **This will be designated as relative north**.

Clones will then spawn around the center of the arena, 2 Omega-M, and 2 Omega-F. An Omega-M and Omega-F pair will always be facing eachother and should be focused on. These two will perform two sets of AOEs that are dependant on the weapons they are holding.

The possible combinations are:

F - Staff | M - Shield
F - Staff | M - Sword
F - Skates | M - Shield
F - Skates | M - Sword

{: .note }
> The "cursed" pattern (F-Staff & M-Shield) can be easily resolved by using the far edges of the waymarks eitherside of the male.
> 
> These waymarks also help to position during Mid/Remote Glitch.

Once the dodge is made, all players must resolve their Mid/Remote Glitch by splitting into the previously designated light parties and moving to the West (LP1) and East (LP2) **relative to Omega's Eye**. 

After each player takes an AOE, two stacks will then appear on two random players. Multiple clones will spawn around the arena, including a line of 3 males, and 1 female in the center. Using the **middle of the 3 males as relative north**, the party must form two stacks in their designated light parties around the female to get pushed back to 1 of 3 safe spots.

Light Party 1 will always anchor West, and Light Party 2 will either be pushed South for Mid Glitch, or East for Remote Glitch.

If the stack players are part of the **same light party** the south most stack relative to the eye must swap positions with their partner. **(video)**

{: .tanks }
> Between the start of the phase and after party synergy Omega-M has changed to Omega-F and vice versa, meaning you will both have to re-provoke your boss.

{: .everyone }
> The party should pre-position at South-West for the upcoming mechanic.

After ~5 auto-attacks from each boss, both Omega-M and Omega-F will cast:
